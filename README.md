# TIC-TAC-AI

Developed a Tic Tac Toe game using Python, implementing the Minimax algorithm for optimal AI gameplay.


Implemented a game loop that allows players to take turns and make valid moves on the game board.


Utilized a recursive approach to calculate the optimal move for the AI player using the Minimax algorithm.

Designed a game state evaluation function that assigns values to different game states, considering potential wins, losses, and draws.


Created a game tree structure to represent all possible game states and enable efficient decision-making by the AI player.

Implemented alpha-beta pruning to optimize the Minimax algorithm, reducing the number of evaluated game states.

Ensured a user-friendly interface by providing clear instructions and valid move validations to enhance the game-playing experience.

Conducted rigorous testing to validate the correctness and accuracy of the Minimax algorithm implementation.

Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and logical thinking in developing an AI player that consistently makes optimal moves.

Documented the project thoroughly, including explanations of the Minimax algorithm, game rules, and implementation details, for easy comprehension by others.
